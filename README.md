# AngryBirdsHeaders
 WIP decompilation of C++ headers from Angry Birds Seasons v4.1.0 for iPhone. Perhaps they may be useful for researching ports and the codebase as a whole. External libraries like the game engine itself will not be included but may be included later on.
 
 This will not produce a working game. This is strictly for reverse engineering native classes.
