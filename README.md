# AngryBirdsHeaders
 WIP decompilation of C++ headers from Classic Angry Birds games, heavily based off Seasons 4.1.0 for iPhone for new code and it's modernized structure however Free with Magic for Meego for old code (both are based off Classic regardless). Perhaps they may be useful for researching ports and the codebase as a whole. External libraries like the game engine itself will not be included but may be included later on.
 
 This will not produce a working game. This is strictly to help with debugging and reverse engineering native code.
